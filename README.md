# Price-prediction-using-neural-networks 

The dataset has 1436 records and details on 38 attributes. The aim of the code is to predict the price of a used Toyota Corolla the specifications in the data. I added a neural network model to the data by using single hidden layer with 2 nodes. Then the result is reecordeed including the RMS error for train and validations sets. The process is repeated by changing the hidden layers and nodes.
